        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          There are many reasons to start a blog for personal use and only a handful of strong ones for business blogging. 
          Blogging for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has a very straightforward purpose â€“ to rank your website higher in Google SERPs, a.k.a.
          increase your visibility.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          As a business, you rely on consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business, you rely on blogging to help you get to potential consumers and grab their attention. Without blogging, your website would remain invisible,
           whereas running a blog makes you searchable and competitive.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          So, the main purpose of a blog is to connect you to the relevant audience. 
          Another one is to boost your traffic and send quality leads to your website.
